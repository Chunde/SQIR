# SQIR & VOQC

SQIR is a **S**mall **Q**uantum **I**ntermediate **R**epresentation for quantum programs. Its intended use is as an intermediate representation (IR) in a **V**erified **O**ptimizer for **Q**uantum **C**ircuits (VOQC).

We describe SQIR and its use in VOQC in our draft [A Verified Optimizer for Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02250). We present details on verifying SQIR programs in our draft [Proving Quantum Programs Correct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01240). Preliminary versions of this work were presented at QPL 2019 and PLanQC 2020.

This repository is split into two parts: SQIR and VOQC. If you are interested in formal verification of quantum programs, you should focus on the SQIR directory (we also recommend Robert Rand's [Verified Quantum Computing tutorial](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~rrand/vqc/index.html)). If you are interested in our verified compiler then take a look at the VOQC directory.

## Table of Contents

The bulk of this respository is Coq proofs about quantum programs and program transformations. Our verified program transformations can be *extracted* to OCaml to produce executable code.

## Notes for Artifact Evaluation

If you would like to build our code on your machine, compilation intructions are under [Compilation](#compilation) below. Alternatively, use our VirtualBox image (see below), which may save time. The contents of this repository are summarized in [Directory Contents](#directory-contents). For instructions on how to run the VOQC optimizer, see the [README in the VOQC sub-directory](VOQC/README.md). (TLDR; cd into the VOQC/benchmarks directory and run `./run_voqc_artifact.sh` to reproduce the results in Tables 2-3 of our paper.)

### VirtualBox Image

The VirtualBox image *TODO* contains precompiled versions of all of our Coq code and comes pre-installed with the relevant versions of the PyZX, tket, and Qiskit compilers. The username is `user` and the password is `password`. The POPL2021 branch of the SQIR repository is checked out in `~/SQIR`.

### Assumptions

There are no assumptions or axioms in the SQIR repository. However, we do use Coq's well-understood `functional_extensionality` axiom and we reuse [QWIRE](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QWIRE)'s libraries for matrices and complex numbers, which contain some axioms (detailed in Section 10 of Rand's [thesis](https://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/3175/)).

As discussed at the end of Section 6 in the VOQC paper, we trust that the OCaml implementations of rational numbers, maps, and sets, used by the extracted code, are consistent with Coqâ€™s. We also note that our translation between OpenQASM and SQIR is not formally verified.

### Correspondence with the VOQC paper

* **Section 3 - SQIR: A Small Quantum Intermediate Representation**
  * The definition of the SQIR language is in SQIR/src/SQIR.v (in particular, see the `ucom` and `com` types).
  * The unitary semantics are defined in SQIR/src/UnitarySem.v (see `uc_eval`).
  * The (density matrix-based) non-unitary semantics are defined in SQIR/src/DensitySem.v (see `c_eval`).
  * The GHZ example is in SQIR/examples/GHZ.v (see the `GHZ` program and `GHZ_correct` lemma).
  * The teleport example is in SQIR/examples/Teleport.v (see the `teleport` program and `teleport_correct` lemma in the DensityTeleport module).
* **Section 4 - Optimizing Unitary SQIR Programs**
  * The list representation of unitary SQIR programs is in VOQC/src/UnitaryListRepresentation.v (`gate_list`). This file also defines several operations over the list representation (e.g. `next_single_qubit_gate`) and equivalence between list programs (`uc_equiv_l`), all parameterized by input gate set. The semantics of a list program is computed by converting it to a SQIR program (`eval`).
  * The gate set we use in VOQC is defined in VOQC/src/RzQGateSet.v (`RzQ_Unitary`).
  * The entry point for our unitary optimizations is the `optimize` function in VOQC/src/Optimize.v. Our main correctness property is `optimize_sound`, which relies on `*_sound` lemmas about each of the component optimizations.
* **Section 5 - Other Verified Transformations**
  * The list representation of non-unitary SQIR programs is in VOQC/src/NonUnitaryListRepresentation.v (`com_list`).
  * As with the unitary optimizations, each non-unitary optimization has an associated `*_sound` lemma that shows that the transformation is semantics-preserving. The mapping transformations also have an associated `*_respects_constraints` lemma that shows that the output program satisfies architecture constraints.
* **Section 6 - Experimental Evaluation**
  * Our code for extracting from Coq to OCaml is in VOQC/extraction. See the READMEs in VOQC and VOQC/benchmarks for instructions on how to run our optimizer on the benchmarks in the VOQC paper. In summary: you can generate the data in Tables 2-3 using the `run_voqc_artifact.sh` script in the VOQC/benchmarks directory. You can generate the data in Appendix C using the `run_voqc.sh` script in VOQC/benchmarks (although this will take a long time due to the size of the benchmarks).

## Compilation

If you would like to compile our Coq proofs follow the instructions under 'Coq' below. If you just want to use the VOQC optimizer, follow the instructions under 'OCaml'.

### Coq

Dependencies:
  * OCaml version >= 4.08.1
  * Coq version >= 8.10.1

Run `make` to compile the core files of SQIR, `make optimizer` to compile proofs about VOQC, and `make examples` to compile proofs of correctness for small quantum programs. Use `make all` to compile everything. Our proofs are resource intensive so expect `make all` to take a little while. On a Macbook Pro running Coq version 8.12.0 and OCaml version 4.10.0 compilation takes around 30 minutes.

### OCaml

Dependencies:
  * OCaml version >= 4.08.1 
  * zarith (`opam install zarith`)
  * dune (`opam install dune`)
  * menhir (`opam install menhir`)
  * batteries (`opam install batteries`)
  * OpenQASM parser (`opam install openQASM`)

For convenience, we have already performed extraction from Coq to OCaml; the extracted files are in VOQC/extraction/ml. `make voqc` will produce an executable in VOQC/_build/default. See [the README in the VOQC directory](VOQC/README.md) for instructions on how to run the optimizer.
