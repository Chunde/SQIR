(** Simple Mapping Extended with Layouts **)

(* This extends the simple mapping approach with a mapping between
   logical and physical qubits. In SimpleMapping, we moved logical 
   qubits to be adjacent before a CNOT and then moved them back to 
   their original locations before continuing. In practice, this is
   very inefficient. It is better to leave the logical qubits in their 
   new positions, and continue from there. *)

(* We will represent a layout with two functions: one that maps from
   logical qubits to physcial qubits, and one that maps from physical
   qubits to logical qubits. We use two functions instead of one to 
   make lookup in either direction efficient. However, this requires
   some extra machinery to describe well-formed layouts. *)
